<p><em>Synoptic data</em> provides a synopsis - a comprehensive and nearly instantaneous picture of the state of the atmosphere. This vignette demonstrates an example workflow for exploring air quality synoptic data using the AirSensor R package and data captured by <a href="https://www.purpleair.com/">PurpleAir</a> air quality sensors.</p>
<div id="loading-purpleair-data" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#loading-purpleair-data" class="anchor"></a>Loading PurpleAir Data</h3>
<p>PurpleAir sensor readings are uploaded to the cloud every 80 seconds or so where they are stored for download and display on the PurpleAir website. In order to capture and download the latest synoptic dataset, begin by importing the required Mazama Science packages and load the PurpleAir Synoptic (“<code>pas</code>”) data.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/pas_load.html">pas_load()</a></code> function is a wrapper function that will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download a raw dataset of the entire PurpleAir network that includes both metadata and recent PM2.5 averages for each deployed sensor across the globe. See <code><a href="../reference/downloadParseSynopticData.html">downloadParseSynopticData()</a></code> for more info.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance the raw dataset by replacing variables with more consistent and human readable names, adds spatial metadata for each sensor, and lists the nearest official air quality monitor. For a more in depth explanation, see <code><a href="../reference/enhanceSynopticData.html">enhanceSynopticData()</a></code>.</p></li>

<div id="purpleair-synoptic-data" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#purpleair-synoptic-data" class="anchor"></a>PurpleAir Synoptic Data</h3>
<p>The <code>pas</code> dataset contains 35 columns, and each row corresponds to different PurpleAir sensors. For the scope of this example we will focus on the columns labeled <code>stateCode</code>, <code>pm25_*</code>, <code>humidity</code>, <code>pressure</code>, <code>temperature</code>, and <code>pwfsl_closestDistance</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>pm25_*</code> column is short-hand for all the columns containing PM2.5 data. The extended names are fairly obvious; the <code>pm25_current</code> column contains data for the most recent air data, <code>pm25_10min</code> contains a 10-minute average of PM2.5 data, and so on.</p>

<p>To visually explore a region, we can use our <code>pas</code> data with the <code><a href="../reference/pas_leaflet.html">pas_leaflet()</a></code> function to plot an interactive <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> map.

A <code>stateCode</code> is the ISO 3166-2 state name abbreviation, hence we limit our filter to only accept <code>stateCode == 'CA'</code>. The <code>pm25_6hr</code> selection, as mentioned above, selects the 6-hour average and restricts the sensors to those whose PM2.5 6-hour average is above 25.0.
