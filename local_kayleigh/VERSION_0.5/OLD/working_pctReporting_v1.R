#' @param aggregationStats Dataframe of statistics as returned by
#' \code{pat_aggregate()}.
#' @param samplingFreq The number of samples measured per hour when the sensor 
#' is operating optimally. Note that currently the sensors measure 30 samples 
#' per hour but were previously sampling at a higher rate.
#' 
#' @description The number of sensor readings recorded per hour are summed over 
#' the course of a calendar day (24 hours unless a partial day is included in 
#' the data), then divided by the number of samples the sensor would record in 
#' an ideal day (30 samples/hour * 24 hours/day) to return a percentage of each 
#' day that the sensor is performing optimally.
#' 
#' @note Purple Air II sensors reporting after the June, 2019 firmware
#' upgrade report data every 2 minutes or 30 measurements per hour.
