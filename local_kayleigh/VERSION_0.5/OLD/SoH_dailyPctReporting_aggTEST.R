#' @description The number of sensor readings recorded per hour are summed over 
#' the course of a calendar day (24 hours unless the \code{pat} datetime column
#' includes a partial day at the beginning or end). This is then divided by the 
#' number of samples the sensor would record in an ideal day 
#' (\code{24 * 3600 / samplingInterval}) to return a percentage of each 
#' day that the sensor is reporting data.
#' 
#' @note Purple Air II sensors reporting after the June, 2019 firmware
#' upgrade report data every 120 seconds. Prior to the upgrade, data were 
#' reported every 80 seconds.
