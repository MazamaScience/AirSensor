Version 1.1.x of the **AirSensor** package allows users to work with the PurpleAir
API which requires API keys. This document describes how to automate work with
private API keys without including them in a code reposotory where they might
be seen by others.

The PurpleAir API is described at: https://api.purpleair.com/

When working with PurpleAir data, you should be aware of the following:

* [PurpleAir Terms of service](https://www2.purpleair.com/policies/terms-of-service)
* [PurpleAir Data license](https://www2.purpleair.com/pages/license)
* [PurpleAir Data Attribution](https://www2.purpleair.com/pages/attribution)

## Obtain an API key

PurpleAir maintains a community forum with a page dedicated to obtaining an API
Key:  https://community.purpleair.com/t/how-to-obtain-an-api-key

## Create a `global_vars.R` file

It is useful to create a file where all API keys and passwords are kept.
I recommend keeping this information in a file named `global_vars.R` which can
be sourced at the RStudio prompt or at the beginning of a script. Here is an
example:

```
# global_vars.R file

# ----- PurpleAir API keys ----------------------------------------------------

PURPLE_AIR_API_READ_KEY <- "********-2A00-11EB-A8CD-42010A800126"     # associated.email@gmail.com
PURPLE_AIR_API_WRITE_KEY <- "********-2A00-11EB-A8CD-42010A800126"    # associated.email@gmail.com
```

## Update the `.gitignore` file

To avoid uploading your private API keys to GitHub where they might be seen by
others, you should create/modify the repository `.gitignore` file so that it
looks something like this:

```
# .gitignore file

# History files
.Rhistory
.Rapp.history

# Session Data files
.RData

# User-specific files
.Ruserdata

# Example code in package build process
*-Ex.R

# Output files from R CMD build
/*.tar.gz

# Output files from R CMD check
/*.Rcheck/

# RStudio files
.Rproj.user/

# produced vignettes
vignettes/*.html
vignettes/*.pdf

# OAuth2 token, see https://github.com/hadley/httr/releases/tag/v0.3
.httr-oauth

# knitr and R markdown default cache directories
*_cache/
/cache/

# Temporary files created by R markdown
*.utf8.md
*.knit.md

# R Environment Variables
.Renviron

# ----- Local customization -----

# API Keys
global_vars.R
```

## Use API keys in your scripts

The **AirSensor** package maintains an internal set of API keys which users can 
set using `setAPIKey()`. These keys will be remembered for the duration of an R 
session. In functions that accept an API key argument, if the passed in API key 
is `NULL`, code will look up a specific named API key to see if that key has 
been set globally. Setting keys globally is a convenience that simplifies the 
scripts written by end users.

Currently supported API keys and associated functions include:

* `"PurpleAir-read"` â€“ Purple Air api_key used in `pas_downloadParseRawData()`
`pat_downloadParseRawData()`, `pat_createNew()`.

Scripts can take advantage of this as seen below:

```
# Script to create new pas or pat objectss

library(AirSensor)

source("./global_vars.R")
setAPIKey("PurpleAir-read", "PURPLE_AIR_API_READ_KEY")

...
```

From this point on in the R session, all **AirSensor** functions that need to pull data from
the PurpleAir API will send the appropriate API key and everything should work.
