\arguments{
\item{pat}{PurpleAir Timeseries \emph{pat} object.}

\item{showPlot}{Logical specifying whether to generate a model fit plot.}

\item{size}{Size of points.}

\item{a_color}{Color of time series channel A points.}

\item{b_color}{Color of time series channel B points.}

\item{alpha}{Opacity of points.}

\item{lr_shape}{Symbol to use for linear regression points.}

\item{lr_color}{Color of linear regression points.}

\item{lr_lwd}{Width of linear regression line.}

\item{lr_lcolor}{Color of linear regression line.}

\item{lr_lalpha}{Opacity of linear regression line.}

\item{ts_shape}{Symbol to use for time series points.}

\item{xylim}{Vector of (lo,hi) limits used as limits on the correlation plot 
axes -- useful for zooming in.}
}
\value{
A linear model, fitting the `pat` B channel readings to A channel 
readings.
}
\description{
Uses a linear model to fit data from channel B to data from 
channel A.

A diagnostic plot is produced if `showPlot = TRUE`.
