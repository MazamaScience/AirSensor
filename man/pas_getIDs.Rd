\usage{
pas_getIDs(pas = NULL, pattern = ".*", isOutside = TRUE, isParent = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pas}{PurpleAir Synoptic \emph{pas} object.}

\item{pattern}{Text pattern used to filter station labels.}

\item{isOutside}{Logical, is the sensor located outside?}

\item{isParent}{Logical, is the sensor a parent station?}
}
\value{

\description{
The incoming \code{pas} object is first filtered based on the 
values of \code{stateCodes}, \code{patter}, \code{isOutside} and \code{isParent}.
The values associated with the \code{"ID"} column are then returned.

This function is useful for returning values associated with specific
\emph{devices}, which are represented by records with \code{isParent = TRUE}.
