\description{
This function calculates the \code{pat_dailySoH} function and 
returns a tibble containing a state of health index for each day of the 
\code{pat} provided. The returned tibble contains columns: \code{datetime}, 
\code{index}, and \code{index_bin}.

The \code{index} column contains a value normalized between 
0 and 1 where 0 represents low confidence in the sensor data and 1 represents 
high confidence. The \code{index_bin} is one of 1, 2, or 3 and represents
poor, fair, and good data respectively. 

The \code{index} is calculated in the following manner:

\enumerate{
\item{If the A or B channel percent reporting is < \code{minPctReporting}, \code{index = 0}}
\item{Otherwise, \code{index = pm25_A_pm25_B_rsquared}}
}

The \code{breaks} are used to convert \code{index} into the \code{indenx_bin}
poor-fair-good values.
