R's `stats::t.test()` function returns an error -- _e.g._ when an hourly subset
contains insufficient data.
* Updated `pas_downloadParseRawData()` to guarantee that all "ID" parameters are
of "character" type and not "integer".

# AirSensor 0.9.12

* Added `sensor_filterDatetime()` function for times that are not aligned to
date boundaries.
* Refactored `sensor_load()` to use `sensor_join()` and other internal functions

# AirSensor 0.8.1

* New `pat_upgrade()` function to bring version 0.6 'pat' objects up to the
version 0.8 data model.
* Improved error messages in `pas_createNew()`.
* Updated `pat_dygraph()` to include support for `parameter = "pressure"`.
* Refactored `pat_aggregateOutlierCounts()`.

# AirSensor 0.8.0

This release completely refactors the way that 'pat' data are downloaded from
ThingSpeak. Additional data columns are added to the standard `pat$data`
dataframe.

* Refactored `pat_downloadParseRawData()` data access times and also reduced the
volume of data downloaded by switching from the `.json` to the `.csv` API from
ThingSpeak. This function now returns a list of five dataframes.

rather than an empty `meta` dataframe.
* `pat_trimDate()` now preserves the first day if it begins at local midnight.

# AirSensor 0.6.10

* Improved error message in `downloadParseTimeseriesData()`.

# AirSensor 0.6.9

* Archive directory structure was changed so that monthly pat files are found
in a monthly directory underneath `pat/YYYY/`. The `pat_loadMonth()` function
was modified to search in this location.
* `pat$meta$pm25_A/B` values now come from the raw data _outdoor_ value
` PM2.5 (ATM)` rather than the _indoor_ value `PM2.5 (CF=1)`. See
https://www2.purpleair.com/community/faq#!hc-what-is-the-difference-between-cf-1-and-cf-atm
* Added more logging to `downloadParseTimeseriesData()`.

# AirSensor 0.6.8

* Changed default value to `countryCodes = NULL` in `pas_createNew()` and
`enhanceSynopticData()` so that it is easier to create _pas_ objects for other
countries.
* Removed `countryCode` and `stateCode` arguments from `pas_get~` functions.
Filter should be done with `pas_filter()` before these functions are called.

# AirSensor 0.6.7

* Fixed bug in `enhanceSynopticData()` which failed to add `pwfsl~` columns when
`includePWFSL = FALSE`. (The columns should still exist but with all NA.)
* All `pas_get~()` functions now support subsetting by `countryCode` and US
`stateCode`.

# AirSensor 0.6.6

* Added `days` argument to `pat_loadLatest()`.
* `pat_load()` and `sensor_load()` default to the last 7 days when no dates
are provided.
* New `pat_trimDate()` function trims data to local time full days.
* `pas_isPas()` no longer requires presence of optional `pwfsl_~` columns.

# AirSensor 0.6.5

`longitude, latitude`.

# AirSensor 0.6.4

* Refactored _pas_ objects to include: `deviceID`, `locationID`, 
`deviceDeploymentID`.

argument is used as the `deviceDeploymentID` unique time series identifier.
* The second and third arguments are now `label` and `pas` and provide an 
alternative to specifying `id`.
* Recreated example data with the new functions.

# AirSensor 0.6.3

* Improved examples.

# AirSensor 0.6.2

* Documentation corrections.
* Recreated all `exaple_pat~` data files with so they have the new metadata
fields: `sensorID`, `locationID` and `deviceDeploymentID`.

# AirSensor 0.6.1

Revisited everything at the `pas` object level:

* Error message harmonization.
* Updated package data files.
* Updated documentation.
* Updated tests.
* Renamed `pas_sensorDeploymentID()` to `pas_deviceDeploymentID()`

# AirSensor 0.6.0

Version 0.6 is a backwards *in*compatible release. It replaces `label` identifier
with a proper "sensor-deployment" identifier and relies on the
*MazamaLocationUtils* package to create location identifiers. Becuase of this
change, archives must be regenerated and many functions must be refactored.

New fields in `pat$meta` include:

* `sensorID` -- same as `ID` but more explicit
* `locationID` -- generated with `MazamaLocationUtils::location_createID()`
* `sensorDeploymentID` -- combination of the above

The following functions were added/refactored to use "sensor-deployment"
identifiers:

* `pas_sensorDeploymentID()` creates a unique "sensor-deployment"
identifier. This identifier is used in creation of file names in the archive
database and as the unique time series identifer in _airsensor_ objects.
* `pas_getColumn()`, `past_getLabels()`, `pas_getIDs()`
* `pat_createNew()`
* `pat_load()`, `pat_loadLatest()`, `pat_loadMonth()`
* `pat_createAirSensor()` 

# AirSensor 0.5.18

# AirSensor 0.5.17

Minor documentation updates and package rebuild.

# AirSensor 0.5.16

* `sensor_polarPlot()` now uses the second-nearest met station if no data are
found at the nearest station.
* `pat_filterDate()` now issues a warning if requested data range is outside
aviailable date range

# AirSensor 0.5.15

Additional functionality for calculating a state of health index to be used as
an overall assessment of sensor functioning.

* renamed `pat_dailyStateOfHealth()` to `pat_dailySoH()`
* new functions `pat_dailySoHPlot()`, `pat_dailySoHIndex_00()`, 
`pat_dailySoHIndexPlot()`

# AirSensor 0.5.14

Modified how `pat_filterDate()` obtains the `timezone` used to interpret the
incoming `startdate` and `enddate`:

1) `startdate` timezone if it is `POSIXct`
2) `timezone` if it is passed in
3) `pat$meta$timezone` otherwise

# AirSensor 0.5.13

* `pat_outliers()` no longer fails in the face of DC signals
* New `pas_getLabels()` functions simplifies the creation of vectors of sensor 
labels (currently used as unique identifiers)

Refactored `PurpleAirSoH_daily~()` functions to use *dplyr* resulting in code
that runs faster and is easier to understand.

* Changed `~SoH_dailyCorrelation()` to `~SoH_dailyMetFit()`.
* Changed `timeseriesTbl_multiPlot()` argument `parameterPatter` to `pattern`.

# AirSensor 0.5.11

Fixed bug in datetime axis that caused `SoH` functions to return missing values
after the switch from PST to PDT.

# AirSensor 0.5.10

Removed `logger.error()` statements from the following low-level functions as
they couldn't be turned off and ended up cluttering the log files:

 * `loadDataFile()`
 * `pas_load()`
 * `pat_createNew()`
 * `pat_loadLatest()`
 * `pat_loadMonth()`
 * `sensor_loadLatest()`
 * `sensor_loadMonth()`
 * `sensor_loadYear()`

with the value `pwfsl_closestMonitorID` when _temporary_ monitors come and go
in the PWFSL database.

# AirSensor 0.5.9

New `PurpleAirSoH~` functions calculate daily state-of-health metrics from PAT
data. These metrics can be combined to create multi-metric indices that provide
an overall assessment of the health of a Purple Air sensor.

 * `PurpleAirSoH_dailyCorrelation()`
 * `PurpleAirSoH_dailyPctDC()`
 * `PurpleAirSoH_dailyPctReporting()`
 * `PurpleAirSoH_dailyPctValid()`
 * `pat_dailyStateOfHealth()`

# AirSensor 0.5.8

* Added `sensor_loadYear()` to load annual files (~2-3 MB).
* `sensor_load()` now attempts to load and join annual files before attempting
the slower process of loading and joining monthly files.

* More explicit use of timezones to avoid local/UTC misunderstandings.

# AirSensor 0.5.3

* Added `make.names` argument to `pat_loadMonth()` and `pat_loadLatest()`.

# AirSensor 0.5.2

* Fixed bug in `pat_dygraph()` which referenced `PWFSLSmoke::parseDatetime()`
which is now deprecated in favor of `MazamaCoreUtils::parseDatetime()`.

# AirSensor 0.5.1

* Upudated data loding to allow for loading data from a local archive. New
functions include: `loadDataFile()`, `getArchiveBaseDir()`,
`setArchiveBaseDir()`.
* All `~_load()` and `~_loadLatest()` functions now call `loadDataFile()` 
* `pat_load()` now continues working in the face of missing data files.
under the hood and will work with data archives found at `archiveBaseDir`.
* Removed `pat_calendarPlot()` and `sensor_calendarPlot()` from the packge.

boundaries when explicit times are specified.

# AirSensor 0.4.6

* `pas_load()` default `retries` was increased from 10 to 30.
* Fixed bug where `pat_createNew()` created time ranges that ended (UTC - local)
hours short of the requested `enddate`.
* Plots generated with `pat_externalFit()`, `pat_internalFit()`, 
`pat_monitorComparison()` and `pat_outliers()` 
now have time axes with sensor local time rather than UTC.
* `pat_externalFit()` and `pat_monitorComparison()` labeling now includes PWFSL 
monitor `siteName`
* Documentation improvements.
* Internal refactoring for consistency.

# AirSensor 0.4.5

* Using `MazamaCoreUtil::stopIfNull()` throughout.

# AirSensor 0.4.4

* Updated requirements: MazamaCoreUtils (>= 0.3.5).
* All time-related functions now specify a timezone explicitly so as to avoid
confusion related to the default `base::Sys.timezone()`.
* `enhanceSynopticData()` now handles presence or absence of `State` column
in raw data obtained from PurpleAir. This was apparently removed some time 
during the summer of 2019.

# AirSensor 0.4.3

* Updated `pat_calendarPlot()` and `sensor_calendarPlot()` to handle discrete
color scales.

* Added "Too Many Requests" error messages to `download~()` functions.
* Added `timezone` parameter to `pas_load()`.
* Included `timezone` information in every internal function call where it can
be specified so that R's default "system local timezone" does not accidentally 
get used.
* When no wind data is provided, use nearest *worldmet* met station in 
`sensor_polarplot()` and `sensor_pollutionRose()`.
* Added `PurpleAirQC_algorithm` to `sensor` objects created by
`pat_createAirSensor()` so that they self-document how they were created.
